    Welcome to BAN Web Training! Hello world.

    <p>
      <i>From Laurel —</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      In the first session, I’ll present. I’ll share how the web became a
      resource for sharing information, especially in the context of academia
      and research. I'll introduce you to some basic concepts of markup
      languages
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkzbI1Tv_rQ">HTML</a> (HyperText
      Markup Language) and
      <a href="https://youtu.be/BUZIaTHm_oE?si=ULWLFsJBE4qHyhJu">CSS</a>
      (Cascading Style Sheets), and what you need to begin building your own
      website. It might be helpful to consider
      <a
        href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/"
        >metaphors</a
      >
      for what a website can be, too. We'll talk about hypertext, a history of
      the web, and accessibility. The
      <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html"
        >world wide web</a
      >, after all, "aims to give universal access to a large universe of
      documents." I'll also weave in my own
      <a href="https://laurelschwulst.com/">work</a> over the years, and point
      out some helpful
      <a href="https://veryinteractive.net/tutorials/index.html">resources</a>
      and <a href="https://veryinteractive.net/library/index.html">articles</a>,
      should you need them!
